/**
 * The Task represents one execution of a parallel subtask on a TaskManager. A Task wraps a Flink
 * operator (which may be a user function) and runs it, providing all services necessary for example
 * to consume input data, produce its results (intermediate result partitions) and communicate with
 * the JobManager.
 *
 * <p>The Flink operators (implemented as subclasses of {@link TaskInvokable} have only data
 * readers, writers, and certain event callbacks. The task connects those to the network stack and
 * actor messages, and tracks the state of the execution and handles exceptions.
 *
 * <p>Tasks have no knowledge about how they relate to other tasks, or whether they are the first
 * attempt to execute the task, or a repeated attempt. All of that is only known to the JobManager.
 * All the task knows are its own runnable code, the task's configuration, and the IDs of the
 * intermediate results to consume and produce (if any).
 *
 * <p>Each Task is run by one dedicated thread.
